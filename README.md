## Developer’s Note

For years I went through the cycle of **coming up with an idea → prototyping → abandoning it**.  
This project was different. My main goal wasn’t to make the biggest or most polished game, but to **finally release something**.  

By deliberately keeping the **scope minimal** focusing on a handful of fun, interactive farming minigames—I was able to push through to release.  
This game is proof to myself that finishing matters more than chasing perfection.
